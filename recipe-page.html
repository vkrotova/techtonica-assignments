            <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large soup pot or dutch oven, combine short ribs, onion, carrot chunks, celery, bay leaves,
                    peppercorns, salt and water.</li>
                <li>Bring it to a boil and then lower the heat, cover and simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat
                    is
                    falling off the bones. Remove the scum that floats to the top with a spoon several times in the
                    beginning.</li>
                <li>While the broth is simmering, heat 1 Tbsp oil in a pan and sauté diced onion for 2-3 minutes. Add
                    chopped garlic and grated carrot and sauté till the carrot starts to soften up, about 6-8 minutes.
                    Plate
                    it out.</li>
                <li>In the same pan, add 1 Tbsp more oil and sauté grated beets for 4-5 minutes. Add sugar, ½ Tbsp white
                    vinegar, and tomato paste and cook for 12-15 minutes, until the beats are tender. You will add this
                    this
                    to the soup pot later.</li>
                <li>Once the Borscht stock is done, remove the short ribs. Shred the meat into big chunks.</li>
                <li>Bring the beef broth to a boil again and add back in beef along with potatoes. Let it simmer on
                    medium
                    low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the sautéed onion and carrot mixture along with shredded cabbage, salt and pepper. Cook for 10
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Add grated beet mixture and let it simmer again for 7-8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in chopped dill and sliced garlic, and let it simmer for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt.
                </li>
                <li>Let it sit at least for 30 minutes to meld all the flavors. Serve with fresh dill, a few garlic
                    slices
                    and a dollop of sour cream.</li>
            </ol>
